# Godot specific files
##############################################
# Files generated by the Godot Engine editor.
# These should generally not be committed to Git.
.godot/                 # Godot 4+ cache and internal project data. ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to ignore.
.import/                # Godot 3.x cache and imported asset data. Good to keep for compatibility.
export_presets.cfg      # Contains export settings (often local paths). Best to manage locally.
*.translation           # Generated translation files.
project.godot.editor_settings # Editor-specific settings for this project, usually local.

# Build artifacts and exported projects
##############################################
# Compiled game binaries or exported projects.
# These are typically generated and not part of the source code.
build/                  # Common folder for build outputs
bin/                    # Another common folder for binaries
export/                 # Output folder for exported games
release/                # Output folder for release builds
*.exe                   # Windows executable
*.zip                   # Zipped exported project
*.pck                   # Godot PCK package (main data for exported games)
*.apk                   # Android package
*.ipa                   # iOS package
*.app                   # macOS application bundle
*.dmg                   # macOS disk image
*.wasm                  # WebAssembly files (for web exports)
*.html                  # HTML files (for web exports, in addition to wasm)

# IDE and OS generated files
##############################################
# Files created by your operating system or integrated development environment.
# These are usually user-specific and shouldn't be shared across the team.
.vscode/                # VS Code workspace settings, launch configs, etc.
.idea/                  # IntelliJ/Rider IDE files
*.sublime-project       # Sublime Text project files
*.sublime-workspace     # Sublime Text workspace files
.DS_Store               # macOS folder metadata
Thumbs.db               # Windows thumbnail cache
desktop.ini             # Windows system file
ehthumbs.db             # Windows system file
*.bak                   # Common backup file extension
*~                      # Emacs/Vim backup files
.#*                     # Lock files (e.g., Emacs)
#*#                     # Another common backup pattern

# Temporary and log files
##############################################
# Various temporary files or logs generated during development.
*.log                   # Log files
temp/                   # Generic temporary directory
tmp/                    # Another generic temporary directory

# Documentation Output - IMPORTANT for GPO 2
##############################################
# In many projects, generated documentation (`docs/`) would be ignored and only pushed
# via CI/CD to a separate branch (like `gh-pages`).
#
# HOWEVER, for THIS GPO 2 project, l'output atteso include la cartella `docs/`.
# Questo significa che la cartella `docs/` e il suo contenuto DEVONO essere committati nel repository.
#
# Quindi, *NON INCLUDERE* `docs/` in questo .gitignore.
# Se volessi ignorare solo i file temporanei all'interno di `docs/` (cosa rara per gdscript-docs-maker),
# potresti aggiungere pattern più specifici, ma per il tuo caso, è meglio non toccare `docs/`.

# GitHub Actions workflow files - IMPORTANT for GPO 2
##############################################
# Your `pipeline.yml` in `.github/workflows/` needs to be committed for the CI/CD extra point.
# Therefore, make sure that `.github/` and its subdirectories are NOT ignored.
# You typically only ignore specific cache/temp files *within* .github/ if any,
# but not the workflow definitions themselves.
# Aggiungere queste linee NON è necessario se non hai altri file in .github/ che vuoi ignorare.
# .github/*
# !.github/workflows/
# .github/workflows/*
# !.github/workflows/pipeline.yml
# Le linee sopra sono un esempio di come ignoreresti tutto in .github/ tranne il tuo workflow.
# Per il tuo progetto, dove hai solo `pipeline.yml`, è sufficiente assicurarsi che
# `.github/` non venga ignorato completamente. Non c'è bisogno di aggiungerlo al `.gitignore`
# in quanto per default Git non ignora queste cartelle.

# External addons (optional, only if you manage them via submodules or other means)
##############################################
# Generally, you *do* want to commit the 'addons/' folder if it contains
# addons you've installed or developed yourself for the project.
# Only ignore it if you're using a specific strategy like Git submodules for external addons.
# addons/
